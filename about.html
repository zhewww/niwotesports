            <h1>What is Niwot Esports?</h1>
            <p>Esports is an abbreviation of the phrase of "Electronic Sports", and
            refers to the professional gaming scene. Niwot Esports is a student led project created to aid in the kindling of a competitive gaming scene at NHS. 
            We've always felt that there has been a stigma attached to the term "gamer", and there is no denying it. 
            This has resulted in gamers being underrepresented at NHS's clubs. Thus, Niwot's mission is two things:</p>
            <ul style="background-color:white;margin-left:40px;">
                <li style="background-color:white;">•To create an easy way to make game-specific clubs under the umbrella of NHS Esports, managed by a passionate and skilled team of individuals.</li>
                <li style="background-color:white;">•To create a professional gaming scene at Niwot by encouraging the improvement of player skill and by organizing school-wide tournaments and events.</li>
                <li style="background-color:white;">•To create a haven for NHS gamers where they feel welcome and can interact with similarly interested people.</li>
            </ul>
