            <h1>Teachers</h1>
            <p>Every club at NHS must have a supervisor that allows the students to stay after school. Teachers are basically
            there to ensure that club members don't burn down the building. If you are considering supporting NHS Esports by
            supervising after school activities, here is what we are looking for:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:30px;">•An hour and a half of supervision after school every week.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:30px;">•Access to a computer lab. This is important so that students that may not have access
            to a game at home or do not have a laptop to bring will still be able to participate in club activities. For
            this purpose, the World Language Lab is a highly sought out and mythical haven of high-end PCs.</p>
            <p>We truly hope that you are willing to support a NHS Esports Club and would be humbled by your supervision. Club 
            leaders will ensure that your headaches and property damage are minimal! If you are interested, please send an email to
            eddiezhew@gmail.com with the name of the division leader who sought you out, the hours and days you can supervise, and 
            what lab spaces you can secure for us.</p>
